I got really busy recently between MQP and everything else so i just didn't have the bandwidth to really care about this assignment.
Created the server file using express but never got around to fully setting up MongoDB.

Used NES.css as my CSS framework because it is a game (snake!). The game speed is still somewhat variable when you reload the page and I'm not sure why.

I'll take the partial credit on this one because I just don't have the bandwidth to finish this while also working on a4 and the final project and mqp and my other classes.
